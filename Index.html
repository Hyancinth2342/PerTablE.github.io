                <br> Americium was first made late in 1944 at the University of Chicago by a team which included Glenn Seaborg, Ralph James, Leon Morgan, and Albert Ghiorso. The americium was produced by bombarding plutonium with neutrons in a nuclear reactor.
                <br> Americium is used for a variety of purposes including
                <br> • Americium is commonly used in smoke alarms, but has few other uses.
                <br> • It has the potential to be used in spacecraft batteries in the future.
                <br> • Currently plutonium is used but availability is poor so alternatives are being considered.
